<p>
A node is a resource that is either a physical or virtual instance of a network accessible host. A resource model is a representation of Nodes in a project.

<p>
The Nodes page is used to browse your Nodes configured in your Project resource model. A filter control can be used to limit the listing to just the Node resources matching the filter criteria. Given the appropriate authorization you can also execute ad hoc commands to your filtered node set.
