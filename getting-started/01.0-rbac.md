#/ title: Role based access
-->
<p>
Everything you see after logging into Rundeck is based on the <i>access control policy</i> (ACL) defined by the administator. 
Resources that are governed by ACLs include access to System wide or Project resources.
</p>
<p>
The Rundeck graphical interface is also driven by the ACL and displays resources and actions that were explicitly granted. 
</p>
<p>
ACL rules apply to your login or group memberships. You can see the groups you belong to by checking the <a href="/user/profile">User Profile</a> page.
