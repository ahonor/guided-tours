#/ title: Plugins

Most of what Rundeck does is via one of its plugins. 
Plugins exist to execute commands on nodes, 
perform steps in a job, send a notification about job status, 
gather information about the hosts in your network, 
copy a file to a remote server, store and stream logs, 
or talk to a user directory.
