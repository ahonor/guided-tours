Most Rundeck navigation is done using the navigation bar on the left side of the page. Using the left navigation bar you can choose between available projects, and once inside a project you can switch to the projectâ€™s Dashboard, Jobs, Nodes, Commands and Activity pages. Project adminstrators will also be able to access the Project Settings pages.

For those with Rundeck administrator access the System settings can be accessed by presing the gear icon in the page header.

Finally, your user profile and logout functions are found under the User icon.
